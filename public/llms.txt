# sosumi.ai - Apple Docs for LLMs

Ever notice Claude struggling to write Swift code?
It might not be their fault!

Apple Developer docs are locked behind JavaScript,
making them invisible to most LLMs.
If they try to fetch it, all they see is:
> This page requires JavaScript.
> Please turn on JavaScript in your browser and refresh the page to view its content.
